# booklist-app

This repository created to learn programming booklist-app as part of coding study at [Hack Your future Belgium](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium), Javascript3 week3-Project!

# my notes during the module:

This week's project was more easy for me. I never struggled or stuck on anything.
I learned how we can easily programm web apps (real world apps).
for instance:

- I learned about vanishing alert message appear and disappear using using `setTimeout` that i was confisung on a lot.
  I also well understood how we can get items form JSON,
  I improved DOM manipulation, like `addEventListener`, `addEventListener`, Alerts: like `success alert`, `danger alert`, `info alert` etc..

## what skills I need to improve is:

I need to improve: `event-loop`, `closures` a bit about `assertion`.
